# CS Notes

Contains direct comparisions of Frameworks and Providers to build your projects,
A curated list of over 600 free Apis, Reccomended Developer Tools, Datasets of 
computer science topics, flashcards, Scientific Calculator, Dictionary and more!

CS Resources utilizes a rest API for its content. All the content is directly 
editable from Django Admin. It is designed to be a useful resource myself and
other developers can rely on to find what they need.

CS Resources runs on a PostgresSQL database hosted in heroku. I use django to
connect to the database and the django rest framework to build a rest api. The
entire project is Open source on github and open to contributors.

## Built with the following
